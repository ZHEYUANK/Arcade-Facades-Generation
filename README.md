In urban renewal, it's essential to preserve the architectural style of historical districts. Traditional design methods, which involve in-depth studies of city history and culture, are time-consuming and often subjective. Although data-driven design methods exist, they require complex, labor-intensive dataset construction and often do not produce high-quality images. Recent research shows that stable diffusion models have potential in generating high-fidelity images based on prompts, but their application in renewing urban historical districts is still limited. Addressing these challenges, our study introduces a framework that combines stable diffusion models with expert system-based digital generative techniques to automatically generate architectural facades with specific styles from professional prompts. We developed a dataset of traditional arcade building facades, trained multiple Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) models, and integrated ControlNet models to enhance control over the facade generation. Our tests show that the LoRA models perform well in terms of precision, realism, and diversity, providing valuable tools for designers and contributing to the preservation and renewal of traditional architectural heritage.
